# TicketingSystemCSSE

By using a ticketing system for public transport network, we can capture, manage and track
the status of passenger issues in an organized and highly collaborative manner. It also
increases the efficiency of the transport service.

In this system Passengers can download the relevant app in their mobile phones. By providing
basic details to the system, passengers can register to the system. Then they can log into the
system and generate a unique QR Code. It’s compulsory to scan the QR Code while getting
on to and off from the bus. Passenger should provide the token number to recharge his
account. If a passenger forgets his Token Number, he can reset it again using the mobile app.
Passenger can view all the journeys he has taken up through the mobile app.

For the foreigners they do not need to register or log in to the system. They will not hold any
account with the public transport provider. They can simply download the app and provide his
passport Id and Credit card details and generate a QR code temporary.
The Transport Manager can retrieve all the details of passenger journeys. He can filter
details using date, journey started location and destination. He can use these details to
identify potential overcrowding, plan timetables etc.

## Assumptions
      • The token is a QR code that can be generated in a mobile phone using the app.
      • If the passenger is a foreigner, he can generate a token by using his passport Id and
      make the payment using his credit card. But he will not hold any account with public
      transport provider.
      • If a passenger forgets his token number, he/she can reset it by providing some basic
      details.
      • If a passenger doesn’t have enough credit in his account to start the journey, he can
      manually pay to the Bus inspector while getting on to the bus.
      • When a passenger scans his QR code while getting on to the bus, the digital reader
      will give an audio output whether he has enough credit or not to reach his
      destination.
      • If a passenger found that, who didn’t scan his QR code while getting on to the bus he
      will be charged a fine.
      • Transport Manager will retrieve information from the app in order to plan his
      timetables, identify potential overcrowding etc.
